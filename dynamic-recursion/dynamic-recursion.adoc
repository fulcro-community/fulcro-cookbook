[#dynamic-recursion]

==== The goal

You have a recursive data structure you need to display in a way that matches the data hierarchy. 

For example.

1. A file system, folders with arbitrary depth, and files. 
1. A tree of comments. 
1. A recipe that contains other recipes.


==== The common solution

The standard solution is to use a https://edn-query-language.org/eql/1.0.0/specification.html#_recursive_queries[recursive queries in EQL] that loads the entire tree. The EQL solution is the most straightforward and covers 95% of all cases.

==== Edge cases

Some cases are just too complex to solve with recursive queries. Let's take the case of a food manufacturer with a slightly more complicated recipe data model. The EQL recursive query solution requires that the same key be present at each level of traversal. We'll see how this becomes an issue in certain scenarios.

==== The problem

You have recipes that are multiple layers deep. At each layer, you might have an ingredient or sub-recipe. This nesting can go on arbitrarily. Think pizza with sauce -> the sauce has sub-components. Sub-components, in turn, might have final ingredients (salt, oil, pepper).

In addition, the connection between the child and parent holds the element's qty and other pertinent information (e.g., the unit of measure `uom`).

Imagine that we also want to lazyload the sub-recipes so we don't load the entire tree up front. Lazyloading immediately disqualifies using EQL to load the tree for one. If you set this up using queries on the defsc component, you will quickly learn that you have infinite recursion. 

===== Setting the scene

TODO: Side-by-side of data tree and rendering tree (comp. instances), how comp queries mimic data model shape
TODO How side-effect (load/mutation/progress/web socket push, etc.) populates some portion of that tree via a remote or data merge with a query fragment.

===== Insights

.Insight #1
****
If a static query doesn't work for that, then the options are dynamic queries or breaking out of the model using a use-component hook.
The former works in 95% of every case, the middle works in a few cases, and the latter covers the rest.

You could ask, if I can do everything with use-component, then why not just supply that and drop the components and static queries altogether?

Because the static query mechanism offers a few advantages:

* Possibility to define a global initial data model locally, component by component, via its `:initial-state`, instead of doing it at some remote place or using component-local state
* Side-effects combined with rendering (i.e., what most React hooks do) cause problems:
 ** Hot code reload doesn't work cleanly since components aren't pure functions anymore
 ** Controlling the data lifecycle becomes more difficult because it is tied to when things are mounted as opposed to compositional logic outside of rendering.
 ** Refactoring UI breaks things (e.g., a side effect A did accidentally gets coupled to B. Move A and B stops working).
* Easier to trace what is going on in the data model because it is more straightforward - each component gets its data only from its parent, and you can see what is the data tree going into the Root component
* The query itself becomes a valuable source of information (which we leverage e.g., for Dynamic Routing)

Remember the ident function is a function and can be used in these situations where you may need to normalize differently based on what's in the data. This is a powerful tool that is often overlooked.

```clojure

(defsc LeafOrNode [_ props extra]
  {:ident (fn []
            (if (:recipe-line-items/id props)
              [:recipe-line-items/id (:recipe-line-items/id props)]
              [:ingredient-line-items/id (:ingredient-line-items/id props)]))
   :query (fn [] {:recipe-line-items/id (comp/get-query RecipeRecipeLineItem)
                  :ingredient-line-items/id (comp/get-query IngredientLineItem)})}

  (if (:recipe-line-items/id props)
    (ui-recipe-recipe-line-item props extra)
    (ui-recipe-ingredient-line-item props extra)))

```
****

===== All the rest...

This mutual recursion is difficult, or impossible, to do with just queries.

TIP: We could still solve it with recursive queries if we separate sub-recipes and the information about quantities. So a Recipe would have data such as `#:recipe{:ingredient-line-items [{:quantity 2, :uom :teaspoon :ingredient {:id ".." :name "Salt"}},...], :sub-recipes [#:recipe{:id "rec2", ...}] :sub-recipe-quantities {"rec2" {:quanity 0.1, :uom :litre}, ..}}` and query `[:recipe/ingredient-line-items (get-query IngredientLineItem) {:recipe/sub-recipes 1} :recipe/sub-recipe-quantities]`. It works, but it could be more elegant. Therefore we explore a different solution here, which enables us to do exactly what we want.

This is a perfect use case for dynamic components and hooks, namely `use-component`.

What we will do is load a Recipe that has a RecipeLineItem that _refers_ to a Recipe (just the ID and name, avoiding the problematic recursive items). We then swap out the reference for a dynamically loaded entity when the user wants to see the details of the sub-recipe. We also use a union query for the RecipeLineItem's child, though it is not strictly necessary (it could simply query for both and always get just one of them).

There is a slight complication with the on-demand loading of the sub-recipe because the use-component hook is slightly tricky to use with something that has yet to be loaded since it needs some data to exist in the client DB. We will therefore initialize the `DynamicRecipe` component via `:initial-params` together with specifying `:initial-state` for the `Recipe` so that the hook can then make an "empty" but properly identified placeholder in the database to hook up to while the load runs. I.e., `use-component` with `:initial-params` generates a `{:recipe/id n}` map and normalizes it (which puts the ident in place for finding it as well). Then the load gets issued. When the details arrive, you've got the full recipe.
